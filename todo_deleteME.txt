TO ASK NEW!
    
    GIT:
        - seriously FUCKED UP! 
        - see the content of git
        - so much garbage added to the git
            .~c9_invoke_4U6qw5.py
            .~c9_invoke_7zoQ9Y.py
            .~c9_invoke_91X4CA.py
            .~c9_invoke_9jsJMv.py
        - templates/addsetup.html still in there!???
    
    - user_vocab_only DOESNT WORK!
        - how do i pass in the modified vocabs?
    - how to handle upvotes upon click? are they just anchors?
        - flask ajax upload or fetch()
    - the first page should be the api
        - giving the user everything there is to know about the vocab he/she wants to add
            - after the definition page, get redirected to ad_vocabulary

        "admins" can "edit" and "delete" all vocabs

     - if not "" then show, just like reference, context and all that

    problems:
        - heroku & git
            - removed "setup_config.py" from git and added it to gitignore
                - now heroku cannot locate the file - ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'setup_config'
                - and i cant push to github - fatal: remote origin already exists. ... RESOLVED!
                - GIHUB potential security vulnerability
        - sorting by date doesnt work since it only looks at the first two numbers of the date. it
        treats the date as a number. so 12/08/2018 comes before 22/05/2018. it completely ignores the months
         and just takes the days.
        - need the clear filter to reset the div containing the options ONLY!
        - odd updating issues with flask template like view count. voiew count updates in the database 
          but on the page, it doesnt right away, it has to be refreshed even though the page was just opened! same
          happened with likes when i had it setup with ajax
        - (add_vocab) what's wrong with this? it keeps picking on upsert for some reason
            mongo.db.vocabs.update({'vocab': vocab_in}, { "$set": {"last_lookup_date": get_today_date()} }, {"$inc": { "lookup_count": 1 } } )
