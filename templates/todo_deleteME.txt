TO ASK NEW!
    
    GIT:
        - seriously FUCKED UP! 
        - see the content of git
        - so much garbage added to the git
            .~c9_invoke_4U6qw5.py
            .~c9_invoke_7zoQ9Y.py
            .~c9_invoke_91X4CA.py
            .~c9_invoke_9jsJMv.py
        - templates/addsetup.html still in there!???
    
    - user_vocab_only DOESNT WORK!
        - how do i pass in the modified vocabs?
    - how to handle upvotes upon click? are they just anchors?
        - flask ajax upload or fetch()
    - the first page should be the api
        - giving the user everything there is to know about the vocab he/she wants to add
            - after the definition page, get redirected to ad_vocabulary
            
            
            
            
notes:
    dash:
        users can "view", "edit" and "delete" their own added vocabs. HOWEVER, admins have the power to bypass this.
        "admins" can "edit" and "delete" all vocabs

    add_vocab:
        the first page should be definition page where the user gets all the info he needs from the previous page.
    REMOVE COMMENTS FROM THE VOCAB DATABASE
    
    add "last_lookup_date" to the vocab views
     - if not "" then show, just like reference, context and all that
     
     
     
     
     edit vocabs
        def view_vocab(vocab_id)
            - IMPORTANT!!! the "mod_date" should be moved to the edit or update function on line 334
            
     fix api (first page)
     think of the game
     upvoting or liking!
     dash visuals - maybe switch to cards?
        - handle user profile access 
     add more filters to dash
        - sorts(ordering as in older first)
        -
